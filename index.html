        <h2>Life of a Stoic</h2>
        <p class="author">September 27, 2022 by Callay Jarrett</p>

        <p>The great Philosophers left us with a wealth of knowledge to help guide us along the way. Many of these knowledge sets 
          came in the form of schools - my favourite being Stoicism. As I read the teachings of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, I am 
          more energized to live life and continue on my day. Though Stoicism doesn't guarantee that life will be perfect, it sure does
          a wonderful job of letting me realize that I can only control so much and no more. This mindset brings me so much solace.
         
          <br>
          <br>

          Stoicism sees wisdom as the highest virtue. It strives to achieve good character, and an understanding of preferred indifferences. Life will never be perfect, but with
          a little philosophy in our lives it becomes more bearable. I don't know where life will take me, but I want to always have the knowledge of those before me in my arsenal.

        <h2>Film-Making</h2>

          I am more and more excited for a life after school every time I think about doing film. It is one of the few things 
          in life that I am excited about. I am looking forward to being on set directing, or writing scripts. I want to be able to 
          tell stories that move people and get people to act in positive ways.

          <br>
          <br>

          I have been practising with my camera and just having fun making different types of content. Putting my imagination 
          to the test and see how far it takes me. I want when people see these stories, they are inspired to continue watching. 
          I want them to be engaged and just in love with the content that  I make. I am looking forward to working with industry professionals 
          and really get my head in the game.
